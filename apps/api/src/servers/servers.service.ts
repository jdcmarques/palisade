// Readiness marker: when is the server actually joinable? POK/ASA pipes ARK's own
// log to stdout, which escalates through THREE markers as it finishes booting —
// `has successfully started!`, then `Full Startup: N seconds`, then finally
// `Server has completed startup and is now advertising for join`. Only the LAST
// means players can connect; the first two fire ~30s earlier (still finalizing
// world save / GC), so flipping on them shows "Running" before the server takes
// joins. We wait for `advertising for join`. The hermsi/ASE image instead prints
// arkmanager's `server is up` on stdout (ASE's own advertising line goes to a
// file inside the container, not docker logs), so keep that for ASE.
//
// The `(?!')` guard is essential: POK logs a line that QUOTES the marker —
//   Waiting for startup completion markers: 'Full Startup:' or 'Server has
//   completed startup and is now advertising for join'
// — while still booting. The real completion line isn't quoted (it ends with
// `. (NN.NGB Mem)`), so rejecting a trailing single-quote after "join" tells the
// two apart, whether we test one line or a multi-line blob.
//
// Conan (acekorneya/conan_enhanced_server): the game logs a one-shot
// `LogServerStats: Startup report. StartupTime=N ... Region=...` exactly when
// startup completes — after the ~30s world load that follows "Rcon is ready" and
// engine init, right as SourceServerQueries opens the query port. That's the true
// joinable moment (verified against a real Conan boot); the earlier RCON/engine-init
// lines fire ~30s too soon. The `StartupTime=` format is Conan-specific, so it
// won't misfire on ARK.
//
// Palworld (thijsvanloef): logs `Running Palworld dedicated server on :<port>` once,
// when the server starts listening — its joinable marker (verified against a real boot).
//
// Minecraft (itzg): the server logs `Done (12.345s)! For help, type "help"` exactly
// once when the world has finished loading and it accepts joins (and RCON).
//
// Icarus (mornedhels, no RCON): the Unreal server binds its game port and the
// GameMode reaches the lobby ("WaitingToStart") — verified against a real boot.
//
// Readiness is now GAME-SPECIFIC and each regex is tested only against its own
// server's container logs (see attachMonitors), so a marker for one game can never
// flip another. This matters because these are different engines that share generic
// lines — e.g. "Engine is initialized" is Conan's too-EARLY line yet coincides with
// Icarus being up, and both ARK images are Unreal like Icarus.
